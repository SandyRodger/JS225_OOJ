### Implicit function execution context

Often context’s implicit
When trying to solicit
A function to do what it does

There’s 3 methods in all
Called apply, bind and call
All explicit, so see them and pause.

If it’s object – dot – function
Then have no compunction
Implicit it will be and was -

'cause the property, `this`,
The receiver does kiss
"Why?" you ask - Oh well simply because.

If there’s no dot we ask
"Is it strict-mode?" Then bask
In the `undefined` background applause

(though on top-level calls
`this` is left to the mawls
Of a `global` or `window’s ` dark jaws)

Not strict? I regret
To inform you you’ve set
Global Object to darken your doors.

So to mem’ry commit it:
It’s not where you writ it
But how it's invoked that will cause 

Little function as bound
To the context it’s found
This is written in Javascript’s laws

### Pseudo-classical object creation

To make an object pseudo-classical,
There are 3 parts, much like a trah-cycle,
Create a dog with the Constructor.
Add `this.name` to lend it structure.
The second part's on prototype
where `bark`'s defined and `.run` and `.bite`.
And third "behaviour delagation",
which simply means an invitation,
for Javascript to seek our verbs
upon the chain the code preserves.
