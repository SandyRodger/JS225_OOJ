### Implicit function execution context

Often context’s implicit
When trying to solicit
A function to do what it does

There’s 3 methods in all
Called apply, bind and call
All explicit, so see them and pause.

If it’s object – dot – function
Then have no compunction
Implicit it will be and was

For the property, `this`,
The receiver does kiss
Why you ask? Oh well simply because.

If there’s no dot then ask
Is it strict-mode? Then bask
In the `undefined` background applause*

(though on top-level calls
`this` is left to the mawls
Of a `global` or `window’s ` strong jaws)

But if not I regret
To inform you you’ve set
Global Object to darken your doors.

So to mem’ry commit it:
It’s not where you writ it
But how its invoked that’s the cause.

At that moment it’s bound
To the context it’s found
As is written in Javascript’s laws
