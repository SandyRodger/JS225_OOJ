      - JavaScript Weekly: An Introduction to First-Class Functions
      - JavaScript Weekly: What in the World is this?!

### done
  - Study your LS181 assessment where you got 100%. This is the technique to use.
  - create comprehensive document (js_225 readme) which has my notes + hyper-links to the parts of the course that reference the relevant material.
    - Read these articles
      - JavaScript Weekly: Making Sense of Closures (read 8.4.25)
    - Create calendar that fits Srdjan's suggested time-frame

 ## [Assessment Format:](https://launchschool.com/lessons/d6ad18da/assignments/b39fe5b1)

- 2 parts:
  1) A 3 hour written test (aproximately 20 questions)
  2) A take-home project -> Apply the concepts in code.

## [Part 1: Study Guide for the Test](https://launchschool.com/lessons/d6ad18da/assignments/588f2f82)

- You need to be able to explain and apply the following concepts:
  - Objects:
    - Organising code into the appropriate objects
    - Object factories
  - Determining/setting function execution context (this)
    - Implicit function execution context
    - explicit function execution context
    - dealing with context loss
    - lexical scope
  - scope and closures
    - higher order functions
    - creating and using private data
    - garbage collection
    - IIFEs
    - Partial function application
  - Object creation patterns
    - class syntax
    - constructor functions
    - pseudo-classical pattern
    - Prototype objects
    - Behaviour delegation.
