# [JS225_OOJ](https://launchschool.com/courses/a920bdfc/home)

## 1 About this Course
### What this course covers
  - Dig deeper into Javascript:
    - functions
    - Execution context
    - scope
    - closures
    - OOJ
  - After this course you will be able to:
    - build basic applications in Javascript
    - Move on to the next course, in which you will:
      - create more complex Javascript projects that:
        - Interact with the DOM
        - Have more user interactivity
## [2 Objects](https://launchschool.com/lessons/4671d66f/home)

### [1	Introduction](https://launchschool.com/lessons/4671d66f/assignments/d4d78556)
  - Objects -> the most versatile of Javascript's data types
  - There's a lot to learn, even relative to the other lessons. Buckle up.

### [2	Prerequisites](https://launchschool.com/lessons/4671d66f/assignments/41ceaaeb)
  - Concise property & concise method syntax.
  -  instead of this:
```javascript
function foo(bar) {
  return {
    bar: bar,
    qux: function() {
      console.log("hello");
    },
  };
}
```
  -  We can do this:
```javascript
function foo(bar) {
  return {
    bar,                      // same as bar: bar
    qux() {                   // same as qux: function()
      console.log("hello");
    },
  };
}
```
