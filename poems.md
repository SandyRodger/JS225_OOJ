### Implicit function execution context

Often context’s implicit
When trying to solicit
A function to do what it does
 
There’s 3 methods in all
Called apply, bind and call
All explicit, so see them and pause.
 
If it’s object – dot – function
Then have no compunction
Implicit it will be and was -

because what we call `this`,
The receiver does kiss
Why you ask? Oh well simply because.

If there’s no dot then ask
Is it strict-mode? Then bask
In the `undefined` background applause*

But if not I regret
To inform you you’ve set
Global Object to darken your doors.
 
So to mem’ry commit it:
It is not where you writ it
But how its invoked that’s the cause.

At that moment it’s bound
To the context it’s found
This is written in Javascript’s laws
 
*unless the function is called on the top level, where `this` will point to the global object
