    - JavaScript Weekly: What in the World is this?!

### done

  - Study your LS181 assessment where you got 100%. This is the technique to use.

## [Assessment Format:](https://launchschool.com/lessons/d6ad18da/assignments/b39fe5b1)

- 2 parts:
  1) A 3 hour written test (aproximately 20 questions)
  2) A take-home project -> Apply the concepts in code.

## [Part 1: Study Guide for the Test](https://launchschool.com/lessons/d6ad18da/assignments/588f2f82)

- You need to be able to explain and apply the following concepts:
  - Objects:
    - Organising code into the appropriate objects
    - Object factories
  - Determining/setting function execution context (this)
    - Implicit function execution context
    - explicit function execution context
    - dealing with context loss
    - lexical scope
  - scope and closures
    - higher order functions
    - creating and using private data
    - garbage collection
    - IIFEs
    - Partial function application
  - Object creation patterns
    - class syntax
    - constructor functions
    - pseudo-classical pattern
    - Prototype objects
    - Behaviour delegation.  

## My mock assessment:

Objects:
  - What are javascript objects?
  - What are the different ways of organising code into objects?
  - What are Object factories?
This:
  - How do you set function execution context?
  - What is meant by 'Implicit function execution context'?
  - What is meant by 'explicit function execution context'?
  - What is context loss and how does one deal with it?
  - Explain lexical scope
scope and closures:
  - What are higher order functions?
  - How does one create and use private data?
  - What is garbage collection?
  - What are IIFEs and why would one use them?
  - What is Partial function application? (Why is it used?, what is it good for? How is it executed?)
Object creation patterns
  - What are the different object creation patterns covered in this course?
  - How does one write a class in Javascript? (class syntax)
    - Inheritance?
    - Polymorphism?
  - How are constructor functions used in javascript?
  - What is the pseudo-classical pattern?
  - Prototype objects
  - Behaviour delegation.
