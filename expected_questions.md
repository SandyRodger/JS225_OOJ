## My mock assessment:

- Objects:
  - Organising code into the appropriate objects
  - Object factories
- Determining/setting function execution context (this)
  - Implicit function execution context
  - explicit function execution context
  - dealing with context loss
  - lexical scope
- scope and closures
  - higher order functions
  - creating and using private data
  - garbage collection
  - IIFEs
  - Partial function application
- Object creation patterns
  - class syntax
  - constructor functions
  - pseudo-classical pattern
  - Prototype objects
  - Behaviour delegation.
